mhl_translatedhostpatch.dll:

The English Patched launcher with the Network address pointers modified to the Forward Fivers Monster Hunter Frontier Server address. This faciliates setup as no hosts file setup would be required from the User's side.

mhl_JPhostpatch.dll:

The original Japanese launcher with the Network address pointers modified to the Forward Fivers Monster Hunter Frontier Server address. This faciliates setup as no hosts file setup would be required from the User's side. 


/ENG-aboutblank:

The English Patched launcher with the Network address pointers patch (mentioned above) as a base. Since the original domain for MHFZ went offline, multiple script errors caused by the page faling to load were plaguing the user experience on the launcher. This bandaid fix replaces the launcher website pointer to "about:blank" which removes all script errors since there is no scripts to load. 

/JP-aboutblank:

Same as above, but for the original Japanese Launcher.
